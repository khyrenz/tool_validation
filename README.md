# tool_validation

A project to store disk images and tool validation reports and templates.

These files are provided to the community to help and encourage all of us to validate our tools, so we can trust their output when it comes to using them in casework. Downloading a report doesn't negate the need for you to do your own validation, but hopefully it helps to add weight to the conclusions you come to yourself. Please use these reports, and please contribute your own to the repository.
